# Modya - Your Efficient Chat Assistant

**Modya** is a versatile and efficient assistant for Telegram chats. I created this bot because the alternatives I tried no longer met my expectations.

## Features

- **Message Counting** – Tracks users' activity in the chat.  
- **Beautiful Telegram Quotes** – Creates visually appealing quotes from messages.  
- **RP Commands** – Supports roleplay actions in chat.  
- **User Leaderboards** – Shows rankings based on activity and engagement.
